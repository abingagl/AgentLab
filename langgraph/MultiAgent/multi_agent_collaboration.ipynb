      "- **Year 2013**: This data point was not explicitly mentioned; however, it would follow consistent growth trends from the previous years considering a stable economic performance overall.\n",

      "- **Year 2017**: The GDP grew by about $893 billion, reflecting continued economic stability and growth.\n",
      "- **Year 2018**: GDP reached approximately $20 trillion in this year, showing substantial growth over time.\n",
